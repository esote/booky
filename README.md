# Booky

Python code to gather random book data from Goodreads and print it out in a copy-pastable manner such that it can be copied into an excel or Google sheets document. Mainly for my own use, but I figured why not share it.

## Booky-v3

*Very* simple CSV data file appendage to negate the need for copy-pasting. It should automatically create a CSV file called `data.csv` and start appending from there. I recommend adding a header to the CSV in the form `Title,Pages,Rating`.

## Booky-v4

Command line options and new stuff
